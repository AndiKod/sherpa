# Sh:erpa's bin

The storage place, where we keep helpful gear, ready to be put at use in case of need during the climbing.

This directory will be placed to the Path to make anything inside available globally, so we'll find three type of executables:

## Sherpa's own toolsKit

`sherpa` itself and utilities made for it.

- sherpa
- use2path

## Project's symlinks

When building a project, the executable bash script or the binary will be symlinked here, so we could invoke it from anywhere and list them to keep track of them.

## Useful CLI programs

If you have it installed already, normally the system will find yours first and execute it, otherwise you won't have to, and just use the ones available here.

In case that you are on a new machine, you won't have to install them back one by one, and the stock will be kept as much as possible on the newest available versions.
