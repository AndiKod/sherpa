# Pure Bash Bible

Helper functions from the book [Pure Bash Bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible).

The goal of this book is to document commonly-known and lesser-known methods of doing various tasks using only built-in bash features. Using the snippets from this bible can help remove unneeded dependencies from scripts and in most cases make them faster.
